# cloudscribe Dynamic Authorization Policy - Demo apps

## Work in progress, coming soon!

cloudscribe Dynamic Authorization Policy is a commercial product with free to try nuget packages that make it possible to manage the requirements of ASP.NET Core Authorization Policies from the UI instead of hard coding them in application Startup. You will see some nag alerts in the site indicating it is using a free trial. These alerts can be removed by purchasing a low cost licese per hostname and installing the license file.

These libraries can work with any ASP.NET Core MVC 2.1 application, but there is an integration library that makes them work even better with sites built on cloudscribe Core, allowing the browsing and selection of cloudscribe Core roles to be used with the authorization ploicies.
